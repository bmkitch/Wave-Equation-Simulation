This is a python script that solve the wave equation in two dimentions
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2})$$
Where c is a user defined field. This allows for fast simulations of waves passing through mediums allowing for the study of light, sound, and many other wave types.
